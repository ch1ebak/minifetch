# Minifetch

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ch1ebak/minifetch/refs/heads/main/screenshots/minifetch.png)

A very minimal system information tool for minimalists who live a minimal life and love minimalism and hate bloat.

> [!WARNING]
> Only for real minimalists.

# Features
- shows your kernel info,
- shows your OS age (so you know whether it's time to distro hop),
- shows your uptime,
- shows your package count (crucial for _real_ minimalists and bloat haters).
