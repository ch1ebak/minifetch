# Minifetch

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ch1ebak/minifetch/refs/heads/main/screenshots/minifetch.png)

This is my very simple system information tool written in Bash.

# Features
- shows your kernel info
- shows your OS age
- shows your uptime
- shows your package count

> [!WARNING]
> Package count only works on Arch. If you're using a different distro, the same look can be achieved using [Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) and [this](https://github.com/ch1ebak/dotfiles/blob/main/backups/fastfetch/config.jsonc) config.
